# shading-algorithm
The following code describes different control algorithms for external Venetian blinds and fabric solar screens. The algorithms are based on a multi-criteria approach, and applies the ISO/DIS 52016-3 to balance visual and thermal comfort, heating and artificial lighting energy needs, and usersâ€™ satisfaction. They integrate multiple parameters related to internal and external conditions: daylight, glare, operative temperature, room occupancy, and vertical irradiance on the window. The control algorithms are applied and validated on a DesignBuilder model.
