# shading-algorithm
The following code describes different control algorithms for external Venetian blinds and solar screens. The algorithms are based on a multi-criteria approach, and applies the ISO/DIS 52016-3 to balance visual and thermal comfort, heating and artificial lighting energy needs, and users’ satisfaction. They integrate multiple parameters related to internal and external conditions: daylight, glare, operative temperature, room occupancy, and vertical irradiance on the window. The control algorithms are applied and validated on a DesignBuilder model.

The code reported is for the Venetian blinds case. In order to apply to the solar screen case, it is sufficient to substitute “Shade_Status_Exterior_Blind” with “Shade_Status_Exterior_Shade”.
